This project was done by ... for the module Bioimage Analysis and Extended Phenotyping (Msc. Bioniformatics) in one week. As a dataset we used https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/alzheimer-mri-dataset and our initial code we got from https://www.kaggle.com/code/psycon/brain-mri-image-alzheimer-classifier. From there we tried to imporve the prediction and implemented a SVM approach as well. Ourt main focus was in trying to understand the underlaying approaches needIn the following you can observe our approaches and results.
